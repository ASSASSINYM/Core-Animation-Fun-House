### Created by Brian Coyner, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017

A suite of ObjC sample code showing how to use various aspects of the Core Animation framework.

Examples include:

- Implicit animations (size, color, border, corners, etc)
- Explicit animations (transforms)
- Animation along a `UIBezierPath`
- BÃ©zier curve editor (with animation along a path)
- Using a `CAReplicatorLayer` and `CAGradientLayer` to create a reflection (with full sublayer animation support)
- Wiggle and jiggle (using two explicit animations)
- Animating a sine wave using custom animatable `CALayer` properties
- Animating a Lissajous Curve using custom animatable `CALayer` properties

Xcode Requirements:
